## **Appendix A: Financial Breakdown**

### **Cost Reduction Analysis**
The 41% cost reduction from $1.95M to $1.15M is achieved through the shared ECOS kernel architecture:

**Individual Project Cost (Without Shared Infrastructure):**
*   13 separate authentication systems: ~$260K (13 × $20K)
*   13 separate database schemas: ~$195K (13 × $15K)
*   13 separate deployment pipelines: ~$130K (13 × $10K)
*   Redundant forecasting/optimization code: ~$260K (duplicated effort across projects)
*   **Total:** ~$1.95M

**Unified Ecosystem Cost (With Shared ECOS Kernel):**
*   Shared Auth0/Web3 system (1×): $50K
*   Unified PostgreSQL schema with Prisma (1×): $40K
*   Monorepo CI/CD infrastructure (1×): $30K
*   Shared forecasting/optimization libraries (1×): $80K
*   Project-specific features (13 projects): ~$950K
*   **Total:** ~$1.15M
*   **Savings:** $800K (41%)

### **Year 3 ARR Projection**
The $183M ARR potential is based on market-validated pricing models and adoption rates:

| Project | Pricing Model | Year 1 Customers | Year 3 ARR |
|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| EverLume (Centennial Bulb) | $50/bulb/month LaaS | 200 facilities | $12M |
| MicroHydro | $0.12/kWh × 500 kW avg | 50 sites | $26M |
| AquaGen (Water Gen) | $0.005/liter × 2M L/day | 100 campuses | $36M |
| AgriConnect | $2K/farm/month SaaS | 500 farms | $12M |
| RegeneraFarm | Carbon credits + $5K/month | 300 farms | $18M |
| PlastiCycle | $80/ton tipping fee | 20 municipalities | $15M |
| EcoHomes OS | 3% transaction fee on $500M GMV | Market launch | $15M |
| ThermalGrid | $0.08/kWh heating | 500 buildings | $19M |
| SolarShare | $20/subscriber/month | 50K subscribers | $12M |
| HempMobility | $100K/contract × 120/year | OEM partnerships | $12M |
| LumiFreq | Hardware + $500/month SaaS | 100 greenhouses | $6M |
| **Total** | | | **$183M** |

*Note: Nuclear projects (NucleoSim, ThoriumOS) excluded as they are long-term R&D plays beyond Year 3.*

### **Internal Revenue Model**
The $1.67M/year internal revenue is generated by the compound operating its own infrastructure:

**Revenue Streams:**
*   Energy savings from MicroHydro (baseload): ~$120K/year (vs grid purchase)
*   Water savings from AquaGen (drinking water): ~$60K/year (vs municipal supply)
*   District heating savings from ThermalGrid: ~$180K/year (vs HVAC)
*   Food production from RegeneraFarm (6-acre farm): ~$240K/year (organic produce sales)
*   Solar credits from SolarShare (200 kW array): ~$80K/year (net metering credits)
*   Construction cost avoidance from EcoHomes OS (40 homes): ~$800K one-time savings annualized over 5 years = $160K/year
*   Lighting cost reduction from EverLume: ~$40K/year (vs traditional replacement cycles)
*   Waste processing revenue from PlastiCycle: ~$100K/year (tipping fees from local community)
*   R&D tax credits for Innovation Layer projects: ~$200K/year
*   Educational/demo site revenue (tours, workshops): ~$500K/year

**Total Annual Internal Value:** ~$1.67M/year (after stabilization in Year 2-3)

**Key Assumptions:**
*   20-acre compound with 40 residential units
*   100 residents + 50 staff members
*   Compound operates at 70% self-sufficiency by Year 2
*   Market-rate pricing for internal services used for comparative analysis
*   Actual costs partially offset through barter and resource sharing within ecosystem
