To scale these 13 projects from isolated experiments into a unified ecosystem, we must standardize the **Shared Components** (the "Nervous System") and deploy **Synergistic Benchmarking Tools** (the "Digital Twin"). This ensures that data from a physical experiment in the greenhouse (#5) immediately improves the simulation models for the bioreactor (#7) or the farming OS (#3).

**Note:** Project #11 is intentionally reserved as a placeholder for future ecosystem expansion and is not yet defined in this document.

### Projects Inventory
The unified ecosystem spans 13 projects, each addressing specific environmental and sustainability challenges:

| Code | Project Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#1** | Foam Homes | Sustainable housing using advanced foam insulation with integrated environmental controls. |
| **#2** | Symbiosis | IoT sensor network for monitoring mycological and biological symbiotic relationships. |
| **#3** | Farm (Closed-Loop Farming) | Automated farming system with nutrient cycling and waste minimization. |
| **#4** | Hemp Lab | Research facility for hemp-based materials and bioproducts. |
| **#5** | Greenhouse (Resonant Light) | Controlled environment agriculture with optimized light frequency research. |
| **#6** | Fast Reactor | Advanced thermal energy generation and management system. |
| **#7** | Bioreactor (Bacteria) | Biological processing unit for waste conversion and nutrient production. |
| **#8** | Bulb (Centennial Bulbs) | Long-life LED lighting with integrated mesh networking capabilities. |
| **#9** | AWG (Atmospheric Water Generator) | Water extraction from ambient air with energy optimization. |
| **#10** | Geothermal | Ground-source heating and cooling with thermal storage loops. |
| **#11** | *(Reserved)* | Placeholder for future ecosystem expansion. |
| **#12** | Solar Gardens | Photovoltaic array with predictive energy management. |
| **#13** | Micro-Hydro | Small-scale hydroelectric generation with stream flow forecasting. |

Here is the breakdown of cross-cutting components and the feedback loops they enable.

### 1. Shared Physical Components (The "Nervous System")
These hardware modules are required across multiple builds. By standardizing these, you reduce supply chain complexity and create a uniform data structure for benchmarking [1].

| Component | Specifications | Used In Projects | Synergistic Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edge Controller** | **ESP32 / STM32** | #2, #5, #8, #9 | A single firmware codebase manages over-the-air (OTA) updates for lights, sensors, and water units [2][3]. |
| **Industrial Controller** | **PLC (Siemens/Allen-Bradley)** | #7, #10, #13 | Standardized Modbus/OPC-UA protocols allow the Hydro turbine (#13) to talk to the Geothermal pumps (#10) [4][5]. |
| **Env. Sensors** | **DHT22 / Soil Probe / Lux** | #2, #3, #5, #9 | Humidity data from the AWG (#9) validates the micro-climate models used by the Farm (#3) [6][7]. |
| **Power Meters** | **CT Clamps / Smart Meter** | #8, #12, #13 | Energy usage data from the Bulb (#8) informs the load-balancing algorithms for the Hydro Microgrid (#13) [8][9]. |
| **Compute Node** | **Raspberry Pi / Jetson** | #5, #7, #9, #12 | Edge AI processing for camera feedback (Resonant Light) and predictive maintenance (AWG) [10][11]. |

### 2. Shared Software Modules (The "Digital Brain")
Instead of building 13 separate software stacks, these core libraries are built once and imported by every project to enforce uniform benchmarking [12][13].

*   **`ecosystem-brains/forecasting` (The Prophet Wrapper):**
    *   **Function:** A unified Python library for time-series prediction [14].
    *   **Synergy:** The same LSTM model architecture template (network depth and layer types) is used to predict solar irradiance for **Solar Gardens (#12)** and stream flow for **Micro-Hydro (#13)**. While input features, preprocessing pipelines, and hyperparameters require domain-specific tuning (cloud cover/temperature/humidity for solar vs. precipitation/snowmelt/discharge for hydro), improvements to shared weather normalization code (bias correction, feature scaling) can partially transfer between projects [15][16].
*   **`ecosystem-brains/solvers` (The OR-Tools Wrapper):**
    *   **Function:** A linear programming engine for resource dispatch [17].
    *   **Synergy:** The logic that balances heat loads in **Geothermal (#10)** is mathematically identical to the logic balancing nutrient loads in **Farming (#3)**. One solver optimizes both fluids [18][19].
*   **`hardware-sdk` (The Telemetry Standard):**
    *   **Function:** A shared TypeScript/Python SDK that handles MQTT connections, buffering, and data packet formatting [20].
    *   **Synergy:** Ensures that a temperature reading from a **Foam Home (#1)** and a **Bioreactor (#7)** enter the database with the exact same schema, enabling facility-wide thermal analysis [21][22].
*   **`ecosystem-brains/dispatcher` (The Shared Brain / Orchestrator):**
    *   **Function:** A logical orchestration layer (code resides in `ecosystem-brains/solvers`) that receives forecasts, selects and invokes appropriate solver(s), schedules actions across hardware modules, and handles retries, failures, and logging/metrics.
    *   **Data Flow:** Dispatcher receives predictions from `forecasting` module → Selects optimization strategy from `solvers` module → Issues commands via `hardware-sdk` to physical devices (e.g., AWG units, geothermal pumps).
    *   **Synergy:** Enables coordinated multi-project actions such as triggering **AWG (#9)** water production when **Solar Gardens (#12)** forecast excess power, while simultaneously routing waste heat to **Geothermal (#10)** loops.

### 2.1 Shared Data Schema
To enable uniform benchmarking and cross-project integration, all sensor data and telemetry must conform to a standardized schema:

**Canonical Data Model:**
```json
{
  "sensor_id": "string (UUID)",
  "location_id": "string (project_code-zone, e.g., 'P05-GH-A1')",
  "measurement_type": "string (enum: temperature, humidity, lux, flow_rate, etc.)",
  "measurement_value": "float",
  "unit": "string (SI units: celsius, percent, lux, L/min, kW, etc.)",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 UTC (e.g., '2025-12-30T12:00:00Z')",
  "quality_flag": "string (enum: valid, suspect, error)",
  "schema_version": "string (semver, e.g., '1.0.0')",
  "source_system": "string (project_code, e.g., 'P09-AWG')",
  "ingestion_time": "ISO8601 UTC"
}
```

**Required Fields:** `sensor_id`, `measurement_type`, `measurement_value`, `unit`, `timestamp`, `schema_version`

**Optional Fields:** `location_id`, `quality_flag`, `source_system`, `ingestion_time`

**Example Payload (Temperature Reading from Greenhouse #5):**
```json
{
  "sensor_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "location_id": "P05-GH-A1",
  "measurement_type": "temperature",
  "measurement_value": 23.5,
  "unit": "celsius",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-30T12:00:00Z",
  "quality_flag": "valid",
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "source_system": "P05-Greenhouse",
  "ingestion_time": "2025-12-30T12:00:02Z"
}
```

**Cross-Project Query Convention:** All facility-wide thermal analysis queries use `measurement_type='temperature'` with `unit='celsius'` to aggregate data across all 13 projects, enabling unified heatmap visualizations and thermal optimization.

**Versioning & Migration:** Schema changes require incrementing `schema_version` and maintaining backward compatibility for 6 months. The `hardware-sdk` module validates all payloads against the schema before database insertion.

### 3. Synergistic Benchmarking Tools
These are new tools you must build to visualize the "heartbeat" of the entire RegenCity and use experiments to refine simulations.

**A. The "RegenCity" Digital Twin (System-of-Systems Simulator)**
*   **Purpose:** A master simulation that inputs real-time data from all 13 projects to forecast total resource flows.
*   **Feedback Loop:** If the **Fast Reactor (#6)** simulation predicts a surplus of heat, the Digital Twin suggests ramping up **Bioreactor (#7)** production (which requires heat) or pre-heating the **Geothermal loops (#10)** [23].
*   **Tech Stack:** Unity/Unreal or Three.js visualization connected to the shared PostgreSQL database [24][25].

**B. The "DevRoyalty" Tracker**
*   **Purpose:** A tool to benchmark the economic value of code. It tracks which modules generate the most revenue or savings.
*   **Feedback Loop:** If the **Forecasting Module** saves the **AWG (#9)** network 20% in energy costs, the tracker attributes that value to the code, justifying further R&D investment in that specific library [26].

**C. The "Bio-Feedback" Loop Controller**
*   **Purpose:** An automated benchmarking tool for biological response.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Cameras in the greenhouse (#5) detect plant growth rates under specific light frequencies. This data is fed into the **Symbiosis (#2)** model to see if specific fungal strains accelerate this growth further. The physical result updates the predictive model for both projects simultaneously [27][28].

### 4. How They Inform Each Other (The Growth Loop)
By treating the 20-acre compound as a single organism, physical outputs from one build become data inputs for another.

1.  **The Connectivity Loop (Bulb $\rightarrow$ Farm):**
    *   **Experiment:** You deploy **Centennial Bulbs (#8)** across the property.
    *   **Growth:** These bulbs act as the physical mesh network nodes (Bluetooth/Thread).
    *   **Result:** The **Symbiosis sensors (#2)** and **AWG units (#9)** piggyback on this network, saving the cost of building a separate comms infrastructure [29][30].

2.  **The Thermal Loop (Solar $\rightarrow$ Water $\rightarrow$ Geothermal):**
    *   **Experiment:** The **Solar Garden (#12)** generates excess power at noon.
    *   **Growth:** The **Dispatcher (Shared Brain)** triggers the **AWG (#9)** to produce water.
    *   **Result:** The heat waste from the AWG compressors is captured and dumped into the **Geothermal (#10)** ground loop to "recharge" the ground temperature for winter heating [31].

3.  **The Nutrient Loop (Farm $\rightarrow$ Waste $\rightarrow$ Car):**
    *   **Experiment:** **Closed-Loop Farming (#3)** produces waste biomass.
    *   **Growth:** This biomass is fed to the **Bacteria Bioreactor (#7)** or processed in the **Hemp Lab (#4)**.
    *   **Result:** The efficiency data from processing this waste informs the **Foam Homes (#1)** team on whether bio-fillers can be used to strengthen the wall foam, creating a new material science benchmark [23].

**Analogy:** Think of the ecosystem like a **Human Body**.
*   The **Shared Hardware** (Sensors/Controllers) are the **Nerves**—standardized cells that transmit signals.
*   The **Shared Software** (Forecasting/Solvers) is the **Brain**—processing inputs to make decisions.
*   The **RegenCity Compound** is the **Body**—where the physical actions (eating, moving, heating) actually occur.
*   The **Benchmarking Tools** are the **Consciousness**—observing the body's performance to learn and improve skills over time.
