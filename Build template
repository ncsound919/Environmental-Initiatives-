To ensure your 13 projects scale as a single organism rather than 13 disjointed startups, you need a **Universal ECOS Module Template**. This structure standardizes how each business connects to the shared "Brain" (Software), "Body" (Hardware), and "Home" (RegenCity).

Below is the **Master Template** you should use to define every project, followed by the **Shared Kernel** that they all inherit.

### **The "ECOS" Universal Build Template**

Copy and fill this for each of the 13 projects. This ensures every business aligns with the technical, physical, and financial architecture.

#### **1. Module Identity**
*   **Project ID:** `[#1 – #13]`
*   **Internal Name:** `[e.g., EverLume, AgriConnect]`
*   **One-Line Pitch:** `[The "X" for "Y"]`
*   **Complexity Tier:** `[Low (IoT) | Mid (SaaS) | High (Deep Tech)]`

#### **2. The Digital "Brain" (Software)**
*   **Primary Function:** `[Optimization | Forecasting | Simulation | Control]`
*   **Specific Logic:** `[e.g., Bayesian failure prediction, LSTM demand forecasting]`
*   **Key Python Libraries:** `[e.g., Prophet, OR-Tools, OpenMC, PyTorch]`
*   **Data Inputs:** `[e.g., Humidity, Voltage, Soil pH]`
*   **Control Outputs:** `[e.g., Valve Open/Close, LED Dim/Bright, Robot Toolpath]`

#### **3. The Physical "Body" (Hardware/IoT)**
*   **Device Type:** `[e.g., Sensor Node, PLC Controller, Bioreactor, Robot]`
*   **Edge Compute:** `[ESP32 | Raspberry Pi | Industrial PC]`
*   **Connectivity:** `[MQTT over WiFi | LoRaWAN | Hardwired Ethernet]`
*   **Key Sensors:** `[e.g., DHT22, Flow Meter, Spectrometer]`

#### **4. RegenCity Integration (The Lab)**
*   **Zone Assignment:** `[Zone A (Living) | Zone B (Infra) | Zone C (Ag) | Zone D (R&D)]`
*   **Physical Role:** `[e.g., Streetlights, Soil Inoculation, Power Baseload]`
*   **Integration Goal:** `[What does this prove? e.g., "Validates sensor mesh reliability"]`

#### **5. Business Engine**
*   **Model Type:** `[SaaS | HaaS (Hardware-as-a-Service) | Utility | Licensing]`
*   **Primary Customer:** `[Commercial Farms | Municipalities | Homeowners]`
*   **Revenue Stream:** `[e.g., Monthly Subscription, Tipping Fees, Carbon Credits]`
*   **Unit Economics:** `[e.g., High Margin Software (70%) vs. Volume Hardware (50%)]`

#### **6. Ecosystem Synergy (Inputs/Outputs)**
*   **Depends On (Input):** `[e.g., Needs Power from #13, Needs Data from #2]`
*   **Feeds Into (Output):** `[e.g., Provides Waste to #7, Provides Heat to #1]`
*   **Shared Resource:** `[e.g., Uses the Shared Auth System and Billing Engine]`

#### **7. Build Specs**
*   **Est. Development Time:** `[Months]`
*   **Est. MVP Cost:** `[e.g., $60k–$90k]`
*   **Team Composition:** `[e.g., 1 Firmware Eng + 1 Backend Eng]`

### **The Shared "Kernel" (Inherited by All)**
*Do not rebuild these. All templates above plug into this foundation.*

*   **Repository:** Single Monorepo (Nx/Turborepo).
*   **Authentication:** Unified Auth0/Web3 Login (One User ID across all apps).
*   **Database:** Single PostgreSQL Schema (Prisma) with partitions for each project.
*   **UI Library:** `@ecosystem/ui-components` (Shared buttons, charts, maps).
*   **DevOps:** Single CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions → AWS ECS).
*   **Optimization:** `ecosystem-brains` Python library (Shared forecasting/solver logic).

### **Applied Examples**
Here is how three different projects (Low, Mid, and High complexity) fit into this uniform structure.

#### **Example A: Centennial Bulb (#8) – The Infrastructure Layer**
*   **Identity:** #8 EverLume | "Lighting-as-a-Service" | Tier: Low (IoT)
*   **The Brain:** **Predictive Maintenance Model**. Uses Bayesian reliability to predict failure years in advance.
*   **The Body:** LED Driver with ESP32 MCU, monitoring voltage/thermal cycles.
*   **RegenCity:** **Zone A & B**. Installed as streetlights and housing illumination. Establishes the mesh network for other sensors.
*   **Business:** **HaaS**. Subscription model ($5–$20/bulb/mo) guaranteeing uptime.
*   **Synergy:**
    *   *Input:* Power from Micro-Hydro (#13).
    *   *Output:* IoT mesh backbone for Symbiosis (#2) sensors.
*   **Specs:** 3–5 Months | $60k–$120k | 1 Firmware + 1 Backend.

#### **Example B: Symbiosis (#2) – The Biological Layer**
*   **Identity:** #2 AgriConnect | "The Soil Operating System" | Tier: Mid (SaaS)
*   **The Brain:** **Recommendation Engine**. ML (scikit-learn) matches fungal strains to soil data to maximize yield.
*   **The Body:** Soil sensor nodes (Moisture, pH, NPK) connecting via MQTT.
*   **RegenCity:** **Zone C (Farm)**. Inoculates soil to boost initial crop yields by ~30%.
*   **Business:** **Vertical SaaS**. Monthly subscription + hardware lease fees.
*   **Synergy:**
    *   *Input:* Sensor data pipeline established by #8.
    *   *Output:* Increased crop yields for Closed-Loop Farm (#3).
*   **Specs:** 3–5 Months | $60k–$120k | 1 ML Eng + 1 Full Stack.

#### **Example C: Geothermal Network (#10) – The Utility Layer**
*   **Identity:** #10 ThermalGrid | "District Heat Utility" | Tier: High (Infrastructure)
*   **The Brain:** **Flow & Dispatch Optimizer**. Graph theory (NetworkX) balances heat loads between buildings.
*   **The Body:** PLCs controlling motorized valves and pumps; temperature sensors.
*   **RegenCity:** **Zone A**. Buried loop under the residential zone heating the Foam Homes.
*   **Business:** **Utility**. Long-term heat sales contracts + connection fees.
*   **Synergy:**
    *   *Input:* Excess electricity from Solar (#12) runs pumps.
    *   *Output:* Heating/Cooling for Foam Homes (#1).
*   **Specs:** 5–7 Months | $100k–$180k | 1 Systems Eng + 1 Backend.

### **How to Use This Template**
1.  **Copy the Template** for the remaining 10 projects.
2.  **Fill in the "Brain"** section using the *Software Build* source data (e.g., for #9 AWG, use "Demand Forecasting with Prophet").
3.  **Fill in the "RegenCity"** section using the *20-Acre Blueprint* source data.
4.  **Execute Phase 1:** Build the **Shared Kernel** + **Centennial Bulb (#8)** first. This validates the structure before you spend money on the complex reactors.
