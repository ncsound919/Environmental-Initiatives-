To scale these 13 projects as a unified ecosystem rather than disparate startups, we must structure them using a **Monorepo Architecture** where they share a single "Brain" (optimization libraries), a single "Body" (database/auth), and a single "Home" (the RegenCity compound) [1].

Here is the structural outline for each business, its specific software requirements, and its business model, organized by their deployment phase in your compound.

### **The Shared Foundation (The "ECOS" Kernel)**
*Before building individual apps, this shared infrastructure supports all 13 projects.*
