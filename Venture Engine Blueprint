## 2. BUSINESS LOGIC (Revenue & Incentive Model)

### The Venture Foundry Protocol: Genesis â†’ Assetization â†’ Monetization

**Stage 1: Genesis (Idea Posted)**

A founder posts: "Build an AI Music Production Tool"

1. System auto-scores via **Codex Engine** on 6 dimensions:
   - **Trueness (â‰¥0.60)**: Idea signal clarity \( T = \sigma(3 \cdot (A - \max(B, N, 0.1))) \)
     - A = vision specificity (1.0 = "Build AImusic tool that exports stems" vs. 0.2 = "Build something cool with AI")
     - B = market noise (competitor clutter)
     - N = execution doubts (founder track record issues)
     - **Result**: 0.85 âœ… GO (founder has shipped 2 prior products, clear spec)

   - **Flow (â‰¥0.55)**: Velocity & resource drag \( F = I \cdot D' \cdot R_{src} \)
     - I = initiative (0.8 = founder actively recruiting; 0.3 = someday idea)
     - D = delay (how many weeks to start; normalized)
     - R_src = resource availability (team size ready to claim quests)
     - **Result**: 0.60 âœ… GO (founder has 3 devs ready, starting week 1)

   - **PCS (â‰¥0.62)**: Partner/Criteria Score \( PCS = \sum w_j v_j \) (5 criteria max)
     - Criteria: Market demand (0.9), Talent pool size (0.8), Tech maturity (0.7), Speed to MVP (0.6), Budget ceiling (0.5)
     - Weights: market 30%, talent 25%, tech 20%, speed 15%, budget 10%
     - **Result**: 0.765 âœ… GO (strong demand + deep talent bench available)

   - **RPS (â‰¥0.50)**: Rollout Priority Score \( RPS = (\alpha S + \beta ROI + \gamma PF)(1 - Risk) \)
     - S = market saturation (0.85 = enough demand)
     - ROI = revenue forecast (0.8 = $100K revenue potential)
     - PF = profit margin (0.9 = 70% gross margin SaaS)
     - Risk = execution risk (0.15 = low; prior team success)
     - \( RPS = (1/3 \cdot 0.85 + 1/3 \cdot 0.8 + 1/3 \cdot 0.9)(1 - 0.15) = 0.85 \cdot 0.85 = 0.72 \) âœ… GO

   - **CU (â‰¥0.50)**: Capacity Utilization \( CU = G \cdot Rr \cdot Pm \)
     - G = founder readiness (0.8 = engaged weekly)
     - Rr = contributor retention (0.75 = expect 75% to stay 2+ quests)
     - Pm = merge pace (0.85 = ~5 PRs/week expected velocity)
     - **Result**: 0.51 âœ… GO (sufficient delivery power)

   - **Tap10 (informational)**: Top-10 lever effectiveness (doesn't gate)
     - Identifies which business levers matter most: Speed to MVP (0.9), Market timing (0.8), Team hiring (0.7), Code quality (0.6), ...
     - **Use**: Founder tweaks strategy mid-quest based on sensitivity ("Flow.D matters most â†’ reduce timeline")

2. **Outcome**: All gates GO â†’ Quest auto-lists on board + system suggests first 5 sub-quests via template.

**Stage 2: Fractionalization (Breakdown into Sub-Quests)**

System proposes:
- "AI Core Engine" ($2K ECOS, 2% equity, difficulty: Gold, timeline: 4 weeks)
- "UI/Frontend" ($1K ECOS, 1% equity, difficulty: Silver, timeline: 3 weeks)
- "Audio Processing Lib" ($800 ECOS, 0.8% equity, difficulty: Silver, timeline: 2 weeks)
- "API & Docs" ($500 ECOS, 0.5% equity, difficulty: Bronze, timeline: 1 week)
- "DevOps & Deployment" ($700 ECOS, 0.7% equity, difficulty: Silver, timeline: 2 weeks)

Each sub-quest:
- Links to GitHub issue (auto-generated with acceptance criteria from Prisma `Milestone`)
- Specs: "Must handle 5 audio formats, process in <2 sec, export as WAV/MP3"
- Reward structure: 70% base ECOS pay, 30% equity vesting 4yr (1yr cliff); all equity split across team claiming the quest

**Stage 3: Execution (Contributors Claim & Build)**

1. Dev @alice connects GitHub wallet, claims "AI Core Engine" sub-quest
   - Instant team slot lock (no double-claim)
   - Chat opens for collab (async + video call integration optional)
   - PR events automatically trigger smart contract validation

2. Alice pushes commits to quest repo (e.g., `github.com/yourname/quest-47-ai-core`)
   - GitHub App (installed per quest repo) listens for `pull_request.opened` events
   - On PR open: DevRoyalty contract checks: does this PR reference Milestone #47-1? Yes â†’ **PRs flow to contract**

3. Core team reviews PR
   - If approved & merged: GitHub webhook fires â†’ calls DevRoyalty smart contract
   - Contract validates: merged commit hash exists, contributor wallet is registered, quest ID is live
   - **Minting**: Contract mints 70% ECOS immediately (non-vesting) + records 30% equity vesting entry

4. Real-time progress bar updates: "AI Core Engine: 60% done (6/10 sub-components complete)"

**Stage 4: Assetization (Completion â†’ Product)**

All 5 sub-quests merged (100% complete):
1. Master Quest marked DONE in Prisma `Project` record
2. System triggers **media-engine** package:
   - Pulls latest artifacts: code (from repo), docs (from README), demo (compiled binary or SaaS instance)
   - Generates product metadata:
     - Title: "AI Music Production Suite v1.0"
     - Description: Auto-derived from PR comments + quest narrative
     - Demo link: e.g., deployed SaaS instance at `https://ai-music-tool.vercel.app?demo=true`
     - Changelog: Linked to all merged PR titles
     - Contributors: Alice (70% AI core), Bob (60% UI), Carol (80% Audio Lib), Dave (50% API), Eve (75% DevOps)
       - Each contributor's equity share calculated: Total 100 ECOS base + (Alice: 2%, Bob: 1%, Carol: 0.8%, Dave: 0.5%, Eve: 0.7%)
       - Vesting records created in `EquityRecord` contract table

3. Smart contract emits: `ProductCreated(productId: 47, assetUri: "ipfs://QmXxxx", contributors: [alice, bob, carol, dave, eve])`

4. Product auto-lists on marketplace within 1 hour with:
   - 7-day free trial (if SaaS) or instant download (if code)
   - Contributor bios + earnings dashboard (embedded iframe showing live royalties)

**Stage 5: Monetization (Sales â†’ Perpetual Royalties)**

Customer buys $99 SaaS annual subscription:
1. Payment processed via Stripe (or wallet for crypto)
2. **Revenue split** via smart contract (deterministic, on-chain):
   ```
   Total: $99
   â†’ Contributors (60%): $59.40
      - Alice (70%): $41.58 [vests 10% immediately, rest 4yr from today]
      - Bob (60%): $35.64
      - Carol (80%): $47.52
      - Dave (50%): $29.70
      - Eve (75%): $44.55
   â†’ Platform (15%): $14.85 [ops fund]
   â†’ Founder (15%): $14.85 [quest initiation reward]
   â†’ Future quests (10%): $9.90 [reinvestment]
   ```
3. **Payouts**: Weekly on-chain transfers to contributor wallets (batched, low-fee L2)
4. **Royalty Stream Dashboard** updates live:
   - "Your share of AI Music Suite: +$41.58 this week (1 sale)"
   - 30-day trend: $42, $41, $38, $45, ... (volatile per sales, smoothing over time)
   - Cumulative: $3,240 earned; $1,080 vested; $2,160 locked (vests Apr 2026)

### Key Business Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Quest GO Rate** | % of posted quests passing all 6 gates | Too low = criteria too strict; too high = insufficient filtering |
| **Time-to-Product** | Days from quest open to marketplace | Faster = more feedback loops, higher contributor velocity |
| **Revenue per Quest** | Total sales of resulting product | ROI on equity / ECOS issued per quest |
| **Contributor Retention** | % completing 2+ quests | Network effect; repeated contributors = higher-quality work |
| **Equity Dilution** | Total % issued per quarter | Cap at ~20% per year to avoid inflation; tie to revenue milestones |
| **Platform Take** | 15% of gross sales | Sustainable? Should hit 50% gross margin (5-7% ops cost) |

    ) external onlyGitHubApp {
      // Mint ECOS tokens immediately
      ecoToken.mint(contributor, ecoTokens);
      
      // Record equity vesting (4yr, 1yr cliff)
      equityRecord[questId][contributor] = VestingEntry({
        totalBasisPoints: equityBasisPoints,
        cliffEnd: now + 1 years,
        vestingEnd: now + 4 years,
        claimedBasisPoints: 0

## 4. Key Design Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Polygon instead of Ethereum mainnet** | 100x cheaper gas, <2 sec finality, still decentralized. Users feel instant payouts. |
| **Stripe + Web3 dual payment** | 60% of US devs don't have crypto wallets yet; Stripe reaches everyone. |
| **Weekly (not daily) payouts** | Daily would burn on fees; weekly batches reduce cost, still fast for motivation. |
| **Codex 6-metric scoring** | 6 gates = sufficient filtering without over-optimization. 1-2 gates = spam; 10+ gates = analysis paralysis. |
| **Open quests + seeded templates** | Founder posts idea, system auto-fractures into sub-quests; lowers barrier to entry vs. "design everything yourself". |
| **Equity vesting (4yr, 1yr cliff)** | Industry standard; incentivizes long-term contributor retention; cliff prevents churn early. |
| **Product NFT (non-transferable)** | Proves ownership on-chain without creating secondary market speculation. |
| **Seasonal themes** | Keeps engagement fresh; guides contributor focus; creates urgency ("only Q1 for Light-themed quests"). |

---

## 5. Success Metrics (90-Day Target)

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Quests Posted | 13 (your startups) + 10 (community) = 23 | Week 1 |
| Quest GO Rate | â‰¥85% | Week 2 |
| Contributors Onboarded | 50 (Founding 50) | Week 5 |
| Quests Completed | 5-8 | Week 8 |
| Products Listed | 5-8 (on marketplace) | Week 8 |
| Marketplace Revenue | $10K+ | Week 12 |
| Contributor Retention | â‰¥50% (Quest 2+) | Week 12 |
| DAO Governance Participants | â‰¥30% of contributors | Week 12 |

**Overall**: By Day 90, the Venture Foundry is a **self-sustaining flywheel**. Every quest completion feeds the marketplace, every sale feeds contributor royalties, every royalty brings contributors back for the next quest. **Your operating system for decentralized creation is live.**
